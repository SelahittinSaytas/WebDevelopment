            <h1>"Heroes"</h1>
            <h2>David Bowie</h2>
            <h3>14 October 1977</h3>
            <p>"Heroes" is the twelfth studio album by English musician David Bowie, 
                released on RCA Records on 14 October 1977. 
                The second installment of his "Berlin Trilogy" recorded with Brian Eno and Tony Visconti, 
                "Heroes" continued the ambient experiments of Bowie's previous album Low 
                (released earlier that year) and featured the contributions of guitarist Robert Fripp. 
                Of the three albums, it was the only one wholly recorded in Berlin.</p>
