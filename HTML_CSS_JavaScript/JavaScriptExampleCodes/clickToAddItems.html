			/*
			One of the common uses for JavaScript is form validation — making sure that users are entering in required input and entering expected input. In this example, we will be asking the user for two numbers and then performing some math with those numbers.

			Create the HTML Document
			*/

			// Our HTML page will have two major components:
			// A form to take in two numbers from the user
			// A table to display the results of common math operations between the two numbers

			// Our form will be built with the following:
			// Two <input> elements — with the ids of num1 and num2 — of a type "number." Using this input type limits the user's ability to input characters; he or she can only enter characters supported in numerical fields - numbers, decimal points, positive symbol (+), and negative symbol (-).
			// One button to submit the form, which will be relabeled to "Recalculate" after doing the first set of calculations. By relabeling it, we are letting our end users know that they can run the form again without having to reset it.
			// One button to reset the form

			// Our <form> has two event handlers - onsubmit and onreset.
			// Our onsubmit call is returning the value from our validation function; this is a common practice. When validating forms, it is common to return a Boolean value. If your validation function returns "false," this will prevent the <form> from submitting the data to the action.

			//Our results table will have rows to display results of the following math operations:
			// Addition - Subtraction - Multiplication - Division

			// Our example is also using Bootstrap for the styling. Since we want to keep the example short, we are linking to the Bootstrap CDN.
