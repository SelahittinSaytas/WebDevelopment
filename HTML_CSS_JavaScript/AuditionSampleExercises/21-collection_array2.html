		fruits.shift(); // By calling '.shift()', we take away the first element of the array:

		fruits.unshift("Banana"); // With '.unshift()' "banana", we set it at position 0:

		fruits.slice(0, 2); // The '.slice(0,2)' returns 2 elements, starting from position 0:

		fruits.splice(0, 2); // It returns the elements but does not change the array. '.splice()' on the other hand will return the elements that are removed and change the array.

		fruits[fruits.length] = "Blueberry"; // Another way to add an element to the end of an array without having to create a variable to track the position is by using the length property.

		fruits[2] = "Pineapple"; // If you specify a specific index in an assignment expression, the value at that index will get updated with the new value.

		fruits[5] = "Dragonfruit"; // Unlike many other languages, JavaScript can shrink and grow its array on its own. You can put an element in a specific index and JavaScript will add undefined spots for empty slots between the filled slots

		// fruits.sort(); // Sorts in alphabetical order

		// fruits.join(" - "); // To join in an array separated by a comma
