Sample Audition Exercise

The objective of this exercise is to allow a user to enter a starting number an ending number and a step value into three textboxes on a page. A button will be present that when clicked should output all the even numbers between the start and end value.

Wireframe - labels and input boxes for starting/ending/step numbers, button to Display Events, and results below in text showing the even numbers between start and end counting by the step
In the example above the user has entered 4 and 20 as the start and end, respectively and set the step to 3. This means the numbers 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, and 19 were considered, but only 4, 10, and 16 were displayed.

Error messages should be displayed if:

Any entry is not numeric
The step is not a positive number
The ending number is less than or equal to the starting number
Additional Requirements:

Utilize the bootstrap CSS library form inputs.
Bootstrap should be linked to the page via CDN.
