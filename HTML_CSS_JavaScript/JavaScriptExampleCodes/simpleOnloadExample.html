	<body onload="alert('Page is loaded');">

	<script type="text/javascript">

		// Here is a sample of the onload event. Notice that onload appears as an attribute of the <body> tag.
		// Also notice that it is calling JavaScript’s alert() function:
		
		/*

		The objective of this exercise is to allow a user to enter a starting number an ending number and a step value into three textboxes on a page. A button will be present that when clicked should output all the even numbers between the start and end value.

		In the example above the user has entered 4 and 20 as the start and end, respectively and set the step to 3. This means the numbers 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, and 19 were considered, but only 4, 10, and 16 were displayed.

		Error messages should be displayed if:
		• Any entry is not numeric
		• The step is not a positive number
		• The ending number is less than or equal to the starting number

		Additional Requirements:
		• Utilize the bootstrap CSS library form inputs.
		• Bootstrap should be linked to the page via CDN.



		var startingNumber = prompt("Enter a starting number:", "");
		var endingNumber = prompt("Enter an ending number:", "");
		var stepValue = prompt("Enter a step value:", "");

		function displayEvents() {

			var evenNumbers = 0;

			for(var startingNumber; startingNumber < endingNumber; stepValue++){
				if(startingNumber % 2 == 0){
					console.log(evenNumbers);
					evenNumbers++;
				}
			}
		}

		console.log(displayEvents());
		document.write(displayEvents());
